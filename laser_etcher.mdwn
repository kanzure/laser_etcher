#Introduction
The goal is to make a small laser CNC machine that has a cutting spot of <10 microns.

## unfinished CAD items
* it's missing the top and bottom plates, the bolt hole locations, the leadscrews and leadnuts and bearing mounts and stepper motor mounts, and it needs some kind of right angle bracket to hold the laser optics (i was thinking some kind of optical breadboard at 90 degrees to the motion stage... )

## assembly notes
fenn: I'm not sure the dimensions work the way i had imagined, but it should be close enough to take out any vertical slop with shims

# items with source needed
* This is to prevent an eccentric leadscrew from causing uneven friction with the nut, and to prevent side loading of the axis

  if that works, try replacing the diode with 1W version from ebay (or 2W 445nm laser), custom beam expander and may be required but should be pretty cheap and easy

# design

bearings are needed to prevent the screw from whipping around, as it will be rotating at about 1000rpm. instead of 
making bearing blocks we can(?) buy shaft holders from vxb, sized to fit the OD of the bearing. then, two thrust 
bearings go on either side of the shaft block, constraining the leadscrew in the axial direction. the leadscrew ends 
are machined to have a shoulder and a capture nut. the stepper motor drives the other end of the screw with a helical 
coupler or diaphragm joint and prevents it from whipping around. (?)

kinematic design to prevent binding and flexing. each axis has 3 trucks, 2 on one rail, 1 on the other rail.

grouted construction (moglice epoxy to bed components)

shims to align components vertically

granite or mic-6 plate, as most convenient

# optics calculations

referencing the paper "Characterization of Program Controlled CO2 Laser-Cut PDMS
Channels for Lab-on-a-chip Applications", available from the publisher and at
[http://fennetic.net/irc/laser\_ablation\_profile\_power.pdf](http://fennetic.net/irc/laser_ablation_profile_power.pdf)

fig.7 in the paper shows a full-depth (trapezoidal) channel, cut at "25% speed"

after searching through the paper for values because of the obnoxious lack of units in their graphs, we find the 
parameters used to be:

channel width: 700um
film thickness: 381um
laser wavelength: 10600nm
cutting speed: 254cm/s  (wow!)
cutting power: 60W

this works out to give a power density of 60W/(700micron*0.25*254cm/s)
= 13.5 J/cm^2
and assuming a full-depth cut, 60W/(381micron*700micron*0.25*254cm/s)
= 354 J/cm^3

# cut speed calculations
We'd like machining time for large single-layer designs to take 15 minutes to fully finish, to allow for rapid revision of digital to physical design. That math is:
1,000,000 droplets 25 microns in diameter next to each other single-file * 1.25 for overheard and reaction centers that use the droplets. That's 31,250,000 microns for a single layer (the other layer or two would be much much less).  
31,250,000 microns == 31,250 mm
31250 mm / 15 minutes = 2083mm/min

2083 mm/min == 33966.66 microns/second

with a 40 tpi screw and 400 step/revolution stepper motor:
25400 microns (1 inch) / 40 / 400 steps = 1.5875 microns per step

1.5875 microns/pulse -- full-step that speed requires 21396.32 hz pulses

0.1984375 microns/pulse -- 1/8th microstepping requires 171khz

0.09921875 microns/pulse -- 1/16th microstepping requires 342khz
