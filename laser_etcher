design
------

bearings are needed to prevent the screw from whipping around, as it will be rotating at about 1000rpm. instead of 
making bearing blocks we can(?) buy shaft holders from vxb, sized to fit the OD of the bearing. then, two thrust 
bearings go on either side of the shaft block, constraining the leadscrew in the axial direction. the leadscrew ends 
are machined to have a shoulder and a capture nut. the stepper motor drives the other end of the screw with a helical 
coupler or diaphragm joint and prevents it from whipping around. (?)

kinematic design to prevent binding and flexing. each axis has 3 trucks, 2 on one rail, 1 on the other rail. 


grouted construction (moglice epoxy to bed components)

shims to align components vertically

granite or mic-6 plate, as most convenient



optics calculations
-------------------

referencing the paper "Characterization of Program Controlled CO2 Laser-Cut PDMS
Channels for Lab-on-a-chip Applications", available from the publisher and at
http://fennetic.net/irc/laser_ablation_profile_power.pdf

after searching through the paper for values because of the obnoxious lack of units in their graphs, we find the 
parameters used to be:

channel width: 700um
film thickness: 381um
laser wavelength: 1064nm
cutting speed: 254cm/s  (wow!)
cutting power: 60W

this works out to give a power density of 60W/(700micron*0.25*254cm/s)
= 13.5 J/cm^2
and assuming a full-depth cut, 60W/(381micron*700micron*0.25*254cm/s)
= 354 J/cm^3
